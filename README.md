This is a console-based Hospital Management System developed in C++ using object-oriented programming and file handling. The system allows administrators to manage patients, doctors, and appointments securely. It features a login system with hashed passwords, ensuring that sensitive data like admin credentials are protected. Patient records include ID, name, age, disease, and mobile number, while doctor records store ID, name, age, and specialty. Appointments link patients and doctors with a scheduled date.
The program provides a menu-driven interface to add, view, and update patients, add and view doctors, and book appointments. All data is stored in text files (patients.txt, doctors.txt, appointments.txt) for persistent storage. Input validation is implemented to prevent invalid data entry, making the system safe and easy to use. This project is ideal for learning basic hospital management functionality and C++ file handling concepts.
